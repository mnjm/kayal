## Installation
Kayal supports several installation methods: as a git submodule, a Hugo Module, or through manual installation.

Detailed instructions on how to install Kayal can be found in [Installation](https://mnjm.github.io/kayal/docs/getting-started/) on the demo site. Here's a quick guide on how to install the theme as a git submodule:

1. In your Hugo site directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git submodule add -b main https://github.com/mnjm/kayal.git themes/kayal
    ```

2. Copy config files from `themes/kayal/config/_default` to `config/_default` at the root of your Hugo project. Make necessary configuration changes in these files. Refer to [Configuration](https://mnjm.github.io/kayal/docs/configuration/) on the demo site for more information.
3. Remove `hugo.toml` if present, and build the site.

## Configuration

The config files included with Kayal contain all possible settings recognized by the theme. By default, many of these settings are commented out, but you can simply uncomment them to activate or modify.

Refer to [Configuration](https://mnjm.github.io/kayal/docs/configuration/) on the demo site for more details.

## Addendum
While building this theme, I constantly referred to the source codes of [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) and [Hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). The idea for using markdown aesthetics came from [Archie](https://github.com/mnjm/archie), another Hugo theme.
