Emoji is supported throughout Blowfish by default. Emoji can be used in titles, menu items and article content.

**Note:** The rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack.

Emoji replacements are automatic throughout Blowfish, so you can use shorthand codes in your content and front matter and they will be converted to their corresponding symbols at build time.

**Example:** `see_no_evil` :see_no_evil:, `hear_no_evil` :hear_no_evil:, `speak_no_evil` :speak_no_evil:.

The [Emoji cheat sheet](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.
